This guide was compiled in R Markdown from the [tutorial page for WGCNA](http://labs.genetics.ucla.edu/horvath/htdocs/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA/Tutorials/index.html). None of the work done here was original, and belongs to Peter Langfelder and Steve Horvath in UCLA. The guide I recreated was meant to teach me about WGCNA.
