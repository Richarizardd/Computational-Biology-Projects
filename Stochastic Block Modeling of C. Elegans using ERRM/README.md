Our published report for Statistical Connectomics is "Millerzone-SBM-ERMM-Final.html". You can reproduce our code by running the script "rawRCodeStatConn.R" in R (see instructions below!).


README PLEASE

Several important points for running code smoothly

1. We have attached the c-elegans connectome we used in this folder.
2. We require the mixer and the igraph libraries in R.
Please install before running.
3. To generate the nice looking html file, we used
the R package knitr, and the source is the rmd file.
If you want to compile the HTML file yourself, install the
knitr package, and run knitr on the rmd file.
4. We have followed the example's format closely in the html file,
we the abstract and the code detailed in the html
5. We have attached R file of just the source code.
